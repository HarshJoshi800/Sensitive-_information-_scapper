This Python script is designed to find sensitive information in HTML code. Sometimes, developers forget to remove comments before pushing their code to production, and these comments may contain sensitive information that can be valuable to us as web penetration testers.

The script helps automate the process, saving us the time and effort spent on manually reviewing the code.

Feel free to give it a try and make any changes you need!
